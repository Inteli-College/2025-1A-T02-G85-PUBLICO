# Public Report Module 1

## Sprint 1

### Workload
During this sprint, the project's first kick-off meeting was held to gain a better understanding of the problem context and how the proposed solution could address it. Additionally, the first version of the application’s project plan was created, outlining the expected deliverables for the upcoming sprints and setting deadlines for each one.

### Learning

- Project Management
- Project plan development
- Management of risk and priorities

## Sprint 2

### WorkLoad

During this sprint, the first project documentation artifacts were developed, including the solution description, persona definitions, chosen technologies, solution architecture, and database modeling.

### Learning

- Data modeling
- Architecture modeling
- RAG in theory

## Sprint 3

### Workload

During this sprint, the first version of the application's backend was developed, including the necessary routes and functions to create an in-memory conversation context with an LLM using LangChain. Additionally, the API routes were documented using Swagger, and the application's main requirements were outlined.

### Learning

- Fast API
- API documentation with SWAGGER
- Chatbot with LangChain
- Requirements engineering

## Sprint 4

### Workload

During this sprint, the first routes for embedding local files using LangChain were developed. In addition, a functional first version of the backend was implemented, covering the entire workflow — from receiving the file, embedding it, and storing it in the vector database, to enabling conversation through chat. In this process, the system is capable of retrieving the most relevant documents from the vector database, accessing the conversation history stored in the relational database, and returning a response to the user based on both. Finally, a wireframe for the end-user interface was created, along with a flowchart illustrating the application's main processes.

### Learning

- File Embedding with LangChain
- Vector and relational database usage
- Integration with LangChain
- Creation of flowchart

## Sprint 5

### Workload

During this sprint, the application's frontend was developed and integrated with the backend, resulting in the delivery of a first functional demo running locally for the end user. Additionally, the backend underwent a refactoring process due to the replacement of LangChain with LlamaIndex, which required adapting all relevant functions to support this new approach.

### Learning

- Hands-on with LlamaIndex
- Frontend development using react and typescript
- Unit test with pytest
